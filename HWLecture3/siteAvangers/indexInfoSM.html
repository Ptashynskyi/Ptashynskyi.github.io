    <h1>SPIDER-MAN WILL RETURN IN AVENGERS: ENDGAME</h1>
    <div class="ltext">
        <p>Tom Holland was spotted in Atlanta during Avengers: Endgame's reshoots, which would suggest he's still got a role to play. This backs up an earlier report saying that wall-crawling hero is also confirmed for the Infinity War sequel back in April
            2017. It's no secret that whatever goes down in Endgame will somehow result into the resurrection of some of the dead MCU heroes, including Spider-Man. In fact, most heroes who perished during the Decimation, like Spider-Man, Doctor Strange,
            Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), and most of the Guardians of the Galaxy, are contracted to star in their future standalone films hinting that their supposed deaths are only temporary. This is also why some have gripes with Infinity War's
            twist ending - although directors Joe and Anthony Russo insist that there are intense stakes in the twin Avengers sequels.</p>

        <p>While Marvel Studios is operating on the notion that the unfortunate heroes are dead, countless theories suggest that it may not be the case. Some claim that their souls could be trapped in the Soul World, others meanwhile are convinced that they
            might be in the Quantum Realm - the alternate dimension introduced in the Ant-Man franchise. Regardless of their current whereabouts, fans can expect that they will be brought back to the real world where they can continue their adventures
            past the current Thanos debacle.</p>
