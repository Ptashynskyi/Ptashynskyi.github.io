    <h1>IRON MAN IS TRAPPED IN SPACE AT THE START OF AVENGERS: ENDGAME</h1>
    <div class="ltext">
        <p>The Avengers: Endgame trailer offered us our first look at what the surviving heroes are up to following their defeat in Infinity War, and none was in as dire a situation as Tony Stark. Trapped in space aboard the Benatar with no hope of being
            saved, he doesn't have much time to spare with the ship's oxygen running out. Currently, there's a lot of theories regarding who might save him. Assuming that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) may also be in the cosmos, some believe that she will
            be the one to bring Stark home. Meanwhile, the confirmation that Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) will be getting her own suit in Endgame, coupled with Stark recording a farewell message to her as seen in the trailer, has roused speculations
            that she might go to outer space and save her fiance herself.</p>
        <p>However things pan out, fans can expect Iron Man to make his way back to Earth and join his fellow heroes in the quest to restore order in the universe after The Decimation. This is backed up by several photos from the set of Avengrs: Endgame,
            and a recent advertisement from Audi which confirmed Tony Stark's survival as well. </p>
