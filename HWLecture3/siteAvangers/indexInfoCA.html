    <h1>EVERYTHING AVENGERS: ENDGAME TRAILERS HAVE REVEALED ABOUT CAPTAIN AMERICA'S PLAN</h1>
    <div class="ltext">
        <p>Marvel's marketing strategy for Avengers: Endgame has been to show as little as possible while still being able to drum up interest, and Captain America has been at the heart of the campaign. The first trailer showed that he's clean shaven but
            also still dealing with the emotional loss. The newly released Super Bowl TV spot further highlighted just how difficult this has been on Steve, as he's seen attending a group therapy session to mourn. But, the first Avengers: Endgame trailer
            also confirmed that he will develop a plan that he is not entirely confident in, but hopes it will work - because he doesn't know what he'll do if it doesn't.</p>

        <p>The stakes are higher than ever and Cap's plan appears to be somewhat of a last ditch effort to save the day. This forces Cap to assemble a brand new Avengers roster as evident by the end of the Super Bowl footage. He is shown leading the team
            through a hanger at Avengers HQ and the lineup looks to be Thor, Black Widow, Rocket, Ant-Man, and War Machine. There does appear to be another person behind War Machine, but it is unclear who it is. We know Bruce Banner is at this location
            and with the team, so it could be him, especially since Ronin doesn't appear have been recruited yet based on Black Widow's still shorter hair. This could be the first venture for the group, which is why Natasha Romanoff is seen reassuring
            Steve that his plan will work during the first trailer.</p>
