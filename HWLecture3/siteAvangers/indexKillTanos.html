    <h1>Avengers: Endgame - How Thanos Could be Defeated</h1>
    <div class="ltext">
        <p>Thanos the Mad Titan is kind of a big deal these days. A decade of Marvel Studios movies led to one starring him that painted him as being the king badass of bad guys. The opening five minutes of Avengers: Infinity War alone make him look like
            the toughest, most imposing threat to any and all superheroes. Not only is he a dangerous brick house of a purple man, but his adventures usually lead to him buffing up his power with Cosmic Cubes and Infinity Stones.</p>

        <p>How do you solve a problem like Thanos in the highly anticipated Avengers: Endgame?</p>

        <p>Scouring his comic history, Iâ€™ve compiled a list of all the times Thanos has been taken down a peg. Maybe one of these is that "one in fourteen million chance" that Doctor Strange mentioned in the movie.</p>
